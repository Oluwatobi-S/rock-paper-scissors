This Rock-Paper-Scissors game is a mimic of the hand game version
that is usually played between two people.

In this app version, a player plays against the computer on the
browser's console.

Hence, to play this game, the browser's console must be opened.

Although, through further development of the app, it will be possible 
to play the game entirely on the front end - i.e., in the browser's window.
